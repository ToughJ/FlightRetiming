# FlightRetiming
This repository contains flight delay datasets and code used in the paper "Flight retiming problem under time-dependent uncertainty".
#### Code
**This is the custom classes that exist in this project.**
rtData.java
which include Flight.class  & Airport.class

**This is the class used to build the time-dependent robust model for our time-dependent schedul(TDS)**
work_sos_hd.java

**This is the class used to build the non-time-dependent robust model for the non-time-dependent schedule (NTDS)**
work_fb.java

**These are the classes used to generate the evaluation delay data and conduct the evaluation.**
scenarioGenerator.java
evaulatePerformance.java

#### Data
There are data gain from ASQP for time-dependent robust model and non-time-dependent robust model and also the generated scenario data for evaluation.
